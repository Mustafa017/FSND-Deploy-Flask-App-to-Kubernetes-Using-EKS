    "The following steps describe how to run the Flask API locally with the standard Flask server, so that you can test endpoints before you containerize the app:\n",
    "\n",
    "Install python dependencies - These dependencies are kept in a requirements.txt file. To install them, go to the project directory that you’ve just downloaded, and use pip as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " >`pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up the environment - You do not need to create an .env_file to run locally but you do need the following two variables available in your terminal environment:\n",
    "* JWT_SECRET - The secret used to make the JWT, for the purpose of this course the secret can be any string.\n",
    "* LOG_LEVEL - It represents the level of logging. It is optional to be set. It has a default value as 'INFO', but when debugging an app locally, you may want to set it to 'DEBUG'. \n",
    "\n",
    "To add these to your terminal environment, run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```\n",
    "export JWT_SECRET='myjwtsecret'\n",
    "export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the app using the Flask server, from the top directory, run:\n",
    "\n",
    " >`python main.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` in a new browser OR run \n",
    ">`curl --request GET http://localhost:8080/`\n",
    "on the command-line terminal. It will give you a response as `\"Healthy\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try the API endpoints on Command-Line\n",
    "Open another terminal window, and install jq, which is a package that helps to read or manipulate JSON processors. \n",

    "This calls the endpoint 'localhost:8080/auth' with the email/password as the message body. The return value is a JWT token based on the secret string you supplied. We are assigning that secret to the environment variable 'TOKEN'. To see the JWT token, run:\n",

    "or check http://localhost:80/ in the browser. You should see a \"Healthy\" response.\n",
    ">```Known Issue: You may not be able to run the /auth endpoint due to locale issues the Python container. It can be resolved by adding a few more environments in the container, as discussed in this [thread]() or [return a simple string from the auth() method in main.py](). Although, this step is not required for the project.```"
